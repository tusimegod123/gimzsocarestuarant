                <p>
                  In 2014, Gimzsoca International Limited imported its first
                  trip of Nigerian foods and eventually, by 2016 the restaurant
                  was launched, to date. In the past four years, the Gimzsoca
                  restaurant has gained popularity from serving its customers
                  with lovely delicious Nigerian and Ugandan local dishes.{" "}

                <h3>Our Story:</h3>
                <p>
                  Gimzsoca Restaurant is an offspring of the Gimzsoca
                  International limited m√©nage that commenced in 2014. The
                  company has been driven with a motive to bring closer the
                  delectable and mouthwatering West African foods to EastAfrica,
                  in order to bond the two communities. The idea-as absorbed
                  from the enthusiasm, aroused by the various West African
                  movies, (widely recognized in the Eastern region of Africa)
                  has been made tangible and real.
                </p>
